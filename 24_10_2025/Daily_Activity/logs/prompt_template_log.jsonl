Here's a simple explanation of RNN in deep learning:\n\n**RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)** is a type of neural network designed to work with sequential data, like time series, text, or speech. Unlike regular neural networks, RNNs have \"memory\" \u2013 they can remember previous inputs in the sequence, allowing them to understand context and make better predictions.\n\nThink of it like reading a book:\n- A regular neural network would analyze each word independently.\n- An RNN, however, \"remembers\" the previous words (e.g., \"I am happy because...\") to understand the meaning better.\n\n**Key points:**\n1. **Loops:** RNNs have loops that allow information to persist.\n2. **Sequential processing:** They process data step-by-step (e.g., word by word in text).\n3. **Used for:** Predicting the next word, speech recognition, stock price forecasting, etc.\n\n**Limitations:** RNNs can struggle with very long sequences (they may \"forget\" early info). Variants like **LSTMs** and **GRUs** help solve this.\n\nWould you like an analogy or a simple example?"}

Think of it as a set of rules or commands that one AI can send to another to adjust its behavior, like telling a chatbot to be more polite or a game character to move faster. It's like a common language for AI systems to work together."}
